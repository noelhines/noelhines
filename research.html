<div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>&nbsp;It’s 7:00 p.m. on a Friday night and you and your friends have tickets to see your one of your favorite artists. The adrenaline is pumping through your body as you walk into the venue and find your seats, it’s about to be the best hour and a half you could ask for. Now imagine getting to do that, all day, for 3 days straight? All your favorite artists, camping or glamping, and fully immersing yourself in the world that is music festivals.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>What even is a music festival really? A festival is defined as an “often periodic celebration or program of events or entertainment having a specified focus.” This perfectly lays out the definition of a music festival, as most festivals are an annual event, and the focus is the artist and their music. While festivals have been around as early as the 14th century, the true ‘music festivals’ came a bit later. They aren’t some phenomena that started in the 20th century, according to Wikipedia, the music festival emerged in the 18th century as an extension of the urban concert life into a form of seasonal cultural festivity structured around a schedule of music performances or concerts. Music festivals are usually large-scale events, with a variety of musical artists and bands, with multiple stages, preforming shows over the course of either one or several days. Some provide campgrounds for concert goers to stay, others provide shuttles back to hotels and other accommodations. Some festivals you can buy just a single day pass or go all in for the whole weekend. The variety of artists reaches people of all different backgrounds and attracts them all to a common place to share their love of music. This can create a sense of community and freedom.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There is always coverage in mainstream media on the big festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo, SXSW, and even Chicago’s Lollapalooza. According to Nielsen.com, approximately 32 million people attend at least one music festival each year in the U.S. More and more we are beginning to see music festivals host other events in correspondence such as 5k runs, interactive art projects, and more. This essentially turns them into tourist attracting, commercialized, mega entertainment events and people keep on coming back, but why?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>When looking at some of the most popular festival line-ups over the years, 2015 has quite popular lineups. With Coachella bringing in ACDC, Drake, and Jack White as their 3 headliners, and Bonnaroo’s headliners being Billy Joel, Mumford and Sons, Deadmau5, and Kendrick Lamar. These festivals are able to seamlessly integrate all these genres into one cohesive event and bring together the masses. This is an experience you can only get at a music festival. Whereas at a regular concert, you only get to see one artist and usually their opening act, here you can see 8 of your favorite artists and maybe find more you like! It is argued that humans have a need for interpersonal relationships and a sense of belonging. Music festivals can help fulfill that need for a lot of people. The concept of a large-scale event where people are relatively friendly, there are millions of possibilities to make those relationships with fellow concert goers. If you see someone in the crowd for your favorite artists, there’s a good chance they like that artist too, so you already have something in common. In the journal “The Importance of Music Festivals: The Unanticipated and Underappreciated Path to Identity Formation” Rudolph conducted a survey a Bonnaroo. She asked festival guests, their age, how many years they have been coming to Bonnaroo, and Do you plan on making friends or have you already made new friends? The results were interesting with 89% of participants being 13-25, 58% it was their first year at the festival, and 67% planned on making new friends while at the festival. (Rudolph, 2016) Research also shows that festivals are often staged for broad social goals, such as increasing acceptance of diversity and mental health, and more festival goers are aware of these goals and make plans to implement them. These festivals act as a medium to help form communities and give people the time to really enjoy life and themselves. The main reasons I found why people love going to festivals are:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A sense of community</li>
            <li>Self-Growth</li>
            <li>To Build connections</li>
            <li>Just to have fun!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
<ul>
            
</ul>
          <p>If the world is your oyster, then a music festival is Atlantis. A place where you can let go and be yourself, listening to the music that brought everyone together.&nbsp;</p>
