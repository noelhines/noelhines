			    <p>&nbsp;Between the craziness that was already existing in my personal life, work and school I had a lot on my plate at the end of 2019. Unfortunately, I had to make the hard decision to take a semester off of school for the spring of 2020, but it ended up being the best decision for me and I didn’t even know it yet. At the time I was living in Edwardsville with one of my best friends Lindsey, and that was when the first reports came out, COVID-19 was spreading rapidly but it hadn’t made its way to the United States. There was the talk of it never making its way over to America and we were hopeful, but we did not know the reality of a ‘pandemic’ - it was something we had only ever read about in history books, not something that we had to deal with firsthand.</p>
			    <p>The weekend of March 13th rolled around, Lindsey and I had the majority of our high school friends home in town from their respective colleges for spring break. We had debating going to see them that weekend but soon after I asked her “What if this is the last weekend we get to spend with them and go out?” we were promptly out the door. The following Monday March 15th, 2020, our nightmare came true, and the United States was put under lockdown. I had to work that day at Dewey’s, and it was a ghost town. The 5 of us that were there that morning just sat at the bar and watched the news to see what in the world was going on, as we assumed everyone else was. We had very few orders that day, a few short days later everyone was in complete lockdown, and everything was closed except for essential business. Lindsey and I ended up spending a lot of time together making art, exploring the outdoors, adopting a kitten named Scrump and doing whatever our hearts desired-within lockdown protocol- because we had nothing but time on our hands. While all of this was happening, I was watching my friends struggle to find their way in this new ‘normal’ when it came to online college. Luckily for me, I had taken the semester off and was able to learn from them the basics of Zoom University. Covid changed everything as we knew it for the past two years and it was a crazy experience to go through college during it. While the lockdown was horrible it gave me a lot of time to do the things I love and to work on myself, it also somewhat allowed me to fully submerge myself in my gap semester and really take some time for myself.</p>
